## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

No additional dependencies required! The brain system extends your existing MCP server.

### Basic Usage

1. **Start the Brain-Enhanced Server**:
```bash
# With brain features (default)
python src/brain_enhanced_mcp_server.py

# Without brain features (original functionality)
python src/brain_enhanced_mcp_server.py --no-brain
```

2. **Update Your MCP Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-context-manager": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["src/brain_enhanced_mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-context-manager-python"
    }
  }
}
```

- Determines appropriate memory layer (short-term, long-term, etc.)
- Creates connections to similar existing memories
- Calculates emotional weight based on content analysis

### Enhanced `fetch_memory`
- Uses brain search when query is substantial
- Includes memory layer, emotional weight, and access count
- Shows connection types and similarity scores
- Provides analogical reasoning results

### Enhanced `get_context_summary`
- Includes memory insights and layer distribution
- Shows connection patterns and knowledge growth
- Provides AI recommendations for knowledge management
- Displays memory state distribution (active, dormant, etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Memory System Configuration
The brain system includes intelligent defaults, but you can customize:

```python
brain_system.config = {
    "short_term_limit": 50,          # Max memories in short-term
    "memory_decay_threshold": 0.1,   # Below this, memory becomes dormant
    "connection_strength_threshold": 0.3,  # Minimum strength for connections
    "consolidation_threshold": 10,    # Access count for consolidation
    "similarity_threshold": 0.7,     # For automatic connection creation
    "memory_promotion_threshold": 5,  # Access count for layer promotion
}
```

### Hierarchies Customization
You can extend the topic and skill hierarchies:

```python
brain_system.topic_hierarchy["MyFramework"] = [
    "Components", "Routing", "State Management", "Testing"
]

brain_system.skill_hierarchy["MySkill"] = [
    "Basic", "Intermediate", "Advanced", "Expert"
]
```

## üîÑ Automatic Memory Management

The brain system automatically:

1. **Promotes Memories**: Short-term ‚Üí Long-term based on usage
2. **Creates Connections**: Finds semantic and contextual relationships
3. **Manages Decay**: Unused memories become dormant
4. **Consolidates Knowledge**: Frequently used memories become stable
5. **Maintains Connections**: Removes weak connections over time

## üß™ Advanced Usage Examples

### Finding Solution Patterns
```json
{
  "name": "search_similar_experiences",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "API rate limiting error handling",
    "focus_areas": ["Error Handling", "APIs", "Performance"],
    "include_analogies": true
  }
}
```

### Building Knowledge Maps
```json
{
  "name": "get_knowledge_graph",
  "arguments": {
    "center_topic": "Database Optimization",
    "max_depth": 3,
    "connection_types": ["semantic", "functional", "causal"]
  }
}
```

### Learning Path Discovery
```json
{
  "name": "trace_knowledge_path",
  "arguments": {
    "from_concept": "Basic SQL",
    "to_concept": "Database Indexing Strategy",
    "max_hops": 6
  }
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Brain Features Not Working
1. Ensure you're using `brain_enhanced_mcp_server.py`
2. Check that brain features are enabled (not using `--no-brain`)
3. Verify database permissions for `brain_memory.db`

### Performance Issues
1. Adjust `similarity_threshold` to reduce connection creation
2. Lower `short_term_limit` to reduce memory load
3. Run memory maintenance manually if needed

### Memory Classification Issues
1. Add more specific tags to your memories
2. Extend topic/skill hierarchies for your domain
3. Manually promote important memories using `promote_memory_knowledge`

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The brain system is designed for extensibility:

- **LLM Integration**: Use large language models for better memory summarization
- **Visual Knowledge Graphs**: Web-based visualization of memory connections
- **Collaborative Memory**: Share knowledge structures across team members
- **Domain-Specific Hierarchies**: Specialized classifications for different fields
- **Memory Export/Import**: Share and backup knowledge structures
