# 🚀 Announcing: MCP Context Manager with Brain-Enhanced Memory

We're excited to announce the open source release of the **MCP Context Manager with Brain-Enhanced Memory** - a sophisticated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides human brain-like memory management for AI agents.

## 🧠 What Makes This Special?

This isn't just another memory system. We've built something that mimics how the human brain works:

- **🧠 Multilayered Memory Architecture**: Short-term, long-term, episodic, procedural, and semantic memory
- **🔗 Neural Connections**: Automatic relationship discovery between memories
- **📈 Knowledge Growth**: Memories evolve and strengthen over time
- **🎯 Intelligent Retrieval**: Context-aware memory recall with semantic search

## 🎯 Key Features

### Brain-Like Memory System
- **6 Connection Types**: Semantic, temporal, causal, contextual, functional, analogical
- **Memory Promotion**: Frequently used knowledge becomes more accessible
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Visualize how concepts interconnect
- **Learning Paths**: Trace knowledge flow between concepts

### MCP Protocol Compliant
- **Full MCP Support**: Works with Cursor, VS Code, and other MCP clients
- **Project Isolation**: Separate memory contexts by project
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in analytics and optimization
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and configuration

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-context-manager-python
cd mcp-context-manager-python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/brain_enhanced_mcp_server.py
```
