# üöÄ MCP Context Manager: Open Source Launch

## What's New

We're excited to announce the open source release of the **MCP Context Manager with Brain-Enhanced Memory** - a sophisticated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides human brain-like memory management for AI agents.

## Why This Matters

Traditional AI systems have a fundamental limitation: they don't remember. Each conversation starts fresh, each session is isolated, and valuable knowledge is lost between interactions. Our system changes that by mimicking how the human brain works.

## Key Features

### üß† Brain-Like Memory System
- **Multilayered Architecture**: Short-term, long-term, episodic, procedural, and semantic memory
- **Neural Connections**: Automatic relationship discovery between memories
- **Memory Promotion**: Frequently used knowledge becomes more accessible
- **Knowledge Growth**: Memories evolve and strengthen over time

### üîó Intelligent Connections
- **6 Connection Types**: Semantic, temporal, causal, contextual, functional, analogical
- **Auto-Discovery**: Finds relationships between memories automatically
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Visualize how concepts interconnect
- **Learning Paths**: Trace knowledge flow between concepts

### üìä Advanced Features
- **MCP Protocol Compliant**: Full compatibility with Cursor and other MCP clients
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in analytics and optimization
- **Project Isolation**: Separate memory contexts by project
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity matching

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-context-manager-python
cd mcp-context-manager-python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/brain_enhanced_mcp_server.py
```
